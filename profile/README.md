### Hey there ðŸ‘‹! 

This is the GiHub of the Speech, Language, and Deep Learning Lab. It contains source code of some of the projects conducted in [Yossi Keshet](https://keshet.net.technion.ac.il)'s Research Lab. 

The lab's goal is to develop rigorous statistical and machine learning algorithms for modeling and processing speech and language. We are focused on improving the state-of-the-art in applications such as automatic speech recognition, speaker recognition, speech indexing and retrieval, acoustic scene analysis, and language understanding. Furthermore, we contribute to research in human speech communication, phonetics, and medical speech pathology using data-driven methods.
